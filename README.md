# MIPSSim
A Java Simulation of a pipelined MIPS processor with 12 types of Instructions.

Given an assembly program in a text file, each instruction is parsed and placed into memory. The processing pipeline then starts through Fetch > Decode > Execute > Memory > Write Back, outputting details about each stage along the way.
